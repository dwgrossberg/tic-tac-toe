# tic-tac-toe
[Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/dwgrossberg/tic-tac-toe) is a single-page game app that allows users to play their friends (2-player mode) or the computer (1-player mode).

This game was written in vanilla JavaScript built as part of the open-source Odin Project curriculum. 


## Highlights
- 1-player mode features two AI bots: an Easy CPU based on a simple `randomMove` function and an unbeatable Hard CPU based on a custom-built `smartishCPU` function
